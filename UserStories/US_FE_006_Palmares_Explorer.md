# US-FE-006: Hall of Fame Explorer

**Role**: Frontend Expert Agent  
**Objective**: Create a visual "Wall of Winners" for all major competitions.

## 📖 User Story
**As a** Historian,  
**I want** a global view of all competition winners,  
**So that** I can track the dominance of clubs over time.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
1. **Global Palmares Page**: Accessible via `/palmares`.
2. **List/Grid Format**: 
    - Header: Competition Name (e.g., Champions League).
    - Rows/Items: Year | Winner Club Name | Winner Logo.
3. **Filtering**: Allow users to filter the list by **Country** or **Trophy Type** (e.g., only show "UEFA Club" winners).
4. **Interactive Links**: Clicking a winner year should take the user to that club's specific profile for that year (e.g., Clicking "2015" for "Barcelona" takes you to the 2015 squad view).
5. **Design**: Use a "Trophy Case" layout, emphasizing imagery over text density.
